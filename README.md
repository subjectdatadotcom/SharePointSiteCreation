# SharePoint Online Site Creation Script
This PowerShell script automates the creation of SharePoint Online Team and Communication sites in a target tenant, using site metadata provided in a CSV file.

- Skips already existing sites.

- Logs success, type, and any errors per site to a structured report.

- PowerShell 5.1 or newer

- PnP.PowerShell module (auto-installed if missing)
